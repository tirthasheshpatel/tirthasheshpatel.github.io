                <h2>What did you do this&nbsp;week?</h2>

<p>This week was spent mostly polishing my pull request and addressing reviews. I got a few big things out of the way though. Firstly, I refactored the <span class="caps">API</span> to accept a single <code>dist</code> object containing all the required methods. Secondly, I wrote a tutorial to document the usage of the new <span class="caps">API</span>. And lastly, I wrote a benchmark suite to profile the setup and sampling stage of each sampler. Moreover, using a lot of help from Bas (@BvB93 on GitHub), I was able to resolve all the MyPy static typing errors and get the MyPy check passing. While adding tests for the <code>seed</code> parameter, I noticed that I had made a mistake in handling the old NumPy <code>RandomState</code> <span class="caps">API</span>. As I had used global variables to sample from the NumPy <span class="caps">RNG</span>, seeding a generator broke! This was because the underlying (global) NumPy <span class="caps">RNG</span> was overridden by a new <span class="caps">RNG</span> as soon as a new generator with a seed was created. Thankfully, I quickly found a way to avoid the use of global variables and tests started passing again. One of my mentors, Christoph, was interested in using the <span class="caps">UNU</span>.<span class="caps">RAN</span>&#8217;s test suite to write strong tests in SciPy. I have started looking into its test suite and also ported a few tests but this is still a work in&nbsp;progress.</p>
<h2>What is coming up&nbsp;next?</h2>

<p>I have got a lot of work done on the <span class="caps">PR</span> and it&#8217;s shaping nicely: Main components of the <span class="caps">PR</span> have been written; Most tests pass. With this, I hope to mark the <span class="caps">PR</span> as open for reviews soon. I will have to make sure that I have added sufficient tests and documentation. Also, the new code lacks comments which may give reviewers a difficult time. I aim to clean out the newly added code and write more comments to delineate certain parts that might be tricky to understand. I also need to clean up the license file. There was also interest in separating <span class="caps">UNU</span>.<span class="caps">RAN</span> in a submodule. I hope to address some of these points in the upcoming&nbsp;week.</p>
<h2>Did you get stuck&nbsp;anywhere?</h2>

<p>I faced a weird 32-bit Linux failure which was related to my changes. When the <code>randint</code> distribution is input to the <span class="caps">DAU</span> method, it fails with an &#8220;unknown error&#8221; in <span class="caps">UNU</span>.<span class="caps">RAN</span>. I was able to localize the error but failed to find a reason for the failure. I suspect floating-point errors but a deeper inspection needs to be done. For the time being, as this isn&#8217;t inside SciPy (and also only exists on a very specific platform and an old NumPy version), I have skipped that test case. This also led to a squalid revelation: memory leaks :/ This is turning into more of a can of worms than I had initially expected. Sometimes <span class="caps">UNU</span>.<span class="caps">RAN</span> frees allocated memory <i>after</i> calling the error handler. But the error handler is designed to jump out of the C code and return to the Cython code where the error can be raised safely. But, then, the allocated memory is never freed leading to a memory leak. I am not sure how often this happens. But it might be something to investigate in more depth. I will see if this is substantial and look into what can be&nbsp;done.</p>

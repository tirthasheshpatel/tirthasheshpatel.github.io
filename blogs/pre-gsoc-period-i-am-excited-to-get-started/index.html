                <h2>Getting started with GSoC&nbsp;&#8216;20</h2>
<p>I am happy to say that I have been selected as a Student Developer under the GSoC 2020 program. I will be working with <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs">pymc-devs</a>, an organization under the <a href="https://numfocus.org/">NUMFocus Umbrella</a>, to develop a higher-level <span class="caps">API</span> for Gaussian Processes in <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc4">PyMC4</a> under the mentorship of <a href="https://github.com/fonnesbeck">Christopher Fonnesbeck</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aloctavodia">Osvaldo Martin</a>. I am very excited to learn new tools and techniques from my mentors for the project. I aim to complete all the goals listed in my proposal as soon as possible so I can work on models and approximations that are not present in&nbsp;PyMC3.</p>
<h3>My Project&nbsp;Abstract</h3>
<p>My goal for GSoC 2020 is to implement, test, and maintain a higher-level <span class="caps">API</span> for Gaussian Processes in PyMC4 using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Probability and write tutorials/articles and notebooks explaining their&nbsp;usage.</p>
<p>My work consists of implementing many Gaussian Process Models including Student&#8217;s T Process Model and writing optimization methods like Neuton&#8217;s Method and Powell&#8217;s Method to find the maximum a-posteriori of the models that can be used to infer parameters of the model. My goal is also to implement at least one approximation technique when full <span class="caps">GP</span> modelling becomes&nbsp;impractical.</p>
<p><small> <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/6135416450711552">View my project abstract on GsoC page here</a> </small></p>
<h3>My Journey so&nbsp;far&#8230;</h3>
<p>I started using PyMC3 in June of 2019 while I was doing a course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-methods-in-machine-learning">Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning</a> hoping to understand bayesian modelling and <span class="caps">MCMC</span> algorithms. It helped me to understand and write bayesian models in Python with ease without diving deep into the underlying algorithms. I never would have thought that I am going to help develop a tool as complex as this in the near&nbsp;future!</p>
<p>In January 2020, I discovered that PyMC3 is taking part in GSoC&#8216;20 and thought to myself that I may never get a chance to work with such a huge organization and with developers as experienced as <a href="https://github.com/fonnesbeck">Christopher Fonnesbeck</a> and <a href="https://github.com/twiecki">Thomas Wiecki</a>.</p>
<p>So, I gathered some hope in late January and started going through the codebase of PyMC3 and PyMC4. It took me a lot of time and effort to understand the codebase but I had acquainted a lot of knowledge of the basic structure of PyMC3 <span class="caps">API</span> by February. I also made <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc4/pull/213">my first <span class="caps">PR</span></a> during this&nbsp;period.</p>
<p>It was the time to choose a project from the PyMC3 wiki page. Gaussian Process Modelling excited me the most as I had worked a lot with it before to develop some projects. In late February, I decided to post a <a href="https://discourse.pymc.io/t/adding-gaussian-processes-in-pymc4-this-summer/4538">discourse thread</a> on PyMC discourse introducing myself to the <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs">pymc-devs</a> and proposing the&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>Having proposed the project, I started going through the Gaussian Process <span class="caps">API</span> in PyMC3. It was quite a large codebase to go through but I was well acquainted with the <span class="caps">API</span> by the end of February. It helped me to learn a lot about python as well as theano. I made a <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Atirthasheshpatel">series of PRs on PyMC3 project</a> making small changes to the <span class="caps">GP</span> <span class="caps">API</span> around this&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Fully acquainted with the <span class="caps">GP</span> <span class="caps">API</span> of PyMC3 and basic flow of PyMC4 project, I felt confident enough to create a prototype of <span class="caps">GP</span> <span class="caps">API</span> for PyMC4. Following the advice of <a href="https://github.com/fonnesbeck">Christopher Fonnesbeck</a> on the <a href="https://discourse.pymc.io/t/adding-gaussian-processes-in-pymc4-this-summer/4538">discourse thread</a>, I made a <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc4/pull/235"><span class="caps">PR</span> proposing my prototype</a> (which very closely resembled the PyMC3 <span class="caps">API</span>) to the <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs">pymc-devs</a> which was very well received by the developers and my mentors. Many core developers, including <a href="https://github.com/bwengals">Bill Engels</a> (designer of <span class="caps">GP</span> <span class="caps">API</span> in PyMC3), provided reviews using which I was able to refine the <span class="caps">API</span> and my knowledge of <span class="caps">GP</span> Modelling in a bayesian workflow.It also led me to create <a href="https://tirthasheshpatel.github.io/2020-03-16-gaussian-process-in-pymc4/">this blog post</a> explaining my work so&nbsp;far.</p>
<p>Having done so much work prior to GSoC, I decided to start working on a proposal to be submitted to the GSoC page. With the help of <a href="https://github.com/aloctavodia">Osvaldo Martin</a>, I was able to create a very strong proposal that helped me organize the time and tasks for my project. I want to thank <a href="https://github.com/aloctavodia">Osvaldo Martin</a> to provide reviews and positive feedback on my proposal. I was able to submit my proposal on the GSoC page in&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>After a month of suspense and nervousness, I got the following mail from&nbsp;GSoC&#8216;20.</p>
<p><img alt="gsoc mail of acceptance!!!" src="/images/gsoc-mail.png"></p>
<p>It was a relief and moment of pride to see this mail. It is the support from my mentors and parent that have brought me so far in my career that I can&#8217;t thank them more! I am super excited to work with the PyMC team this summer. The journey so far has brought me so much knowledge about software development and Bayesian statistics that I can&#8217;t wait to get started with my project this&nbsp;summer!</p>
<h2>Thank you, Mentors and my lovely&nbsp;Parents!</h2>
<p>The journey so far has helped me learn a lot about bayesian modelling, software development and using tools such as TensorFlow and TensorFlow Probability. Along the way, I was also able to help some pymc users on discourse and I hope to do so in the future&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>I want to thank <a href="https://github.com/fonnesbeck">Christopher Fonnesbeck</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aloctavodia">Osvaldo Martin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs">pymc-devs</a> for giving me this opportunity to work with them on this awesome project! Lastly, I want to thank and dedicate this internship to my parents (especially my late mother), who made me capable of standing up for myself and educated me with unconditional love! I love you, mom and&nbsp;dad!</p>

Summary: This is how I created an article online!

# This actucally worked!

Wow, I wasn't expecting this to work! Firstly because I get so excited, I don't the documentation carefully.
Secondly, this is an awesome feature. I can so so much with this online feature.

For example, let me put a image in my image directory and try to show it here:

<img src="/images/ProfilePic.jpeg" alt="image" width="400"/>

Brrr!!! Brrrrrrrrr!!!!!! BRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! It worked!!

Wow, this actually put an image on my screen. I am startled, bamboozled!!!!

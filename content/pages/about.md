Title: About

Hi, I am Tirth. I am currently a final year computer science undergrad student at Nirma University in India.
I am a maintainer of [SciPy](https://www.github.com/scipy). I participated in GSoC 2020 with PyMC and GSoC
2021 with SciPy. I am currently a Software Engineering Intern at [Quansight Labs](https://www.quansight.com/labs).
For the next four months, I will be working on DLPack to contribute documentation, tests, bug-fixes, and
features to DLPack and related projects (e.g. NumPy, CuPy). Apart from programming, I like to play table
tennis (but I am not good at sports in general :p).

Please look at my [resume]({static}../pdfs/TirthPatelResume.pdf) if you want to know more about me!

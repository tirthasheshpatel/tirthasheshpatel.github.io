Title: About

Hi, I am Tirth. I am a final year computer science undergrad student at
[Nirma University](https://nirmauni.ac.in/) and a Software Engineering Intern at
[Quansight Labs](https://www.quansight.com/labs). I am also a maintainer of
[SciPy](https://www.github.com/scipy). I participated in GSoC 2020 with PyMC and
GSoC 2021 with SciPy. For the next four months, I will be working on DLPack to
contribute documentation, tests, bug-fixes, and features to DLPack and related
projects (e.g. NumPy, CuPy). Apart from programming, I like to play table
tennis (but I am not good at sports in general :p).

Please look at my [resume]({static}../pdfs/TirthPatelResume.pdf) if you want
to know more about me!

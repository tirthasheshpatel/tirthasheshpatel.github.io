Title: About

Hi, I am Tirth. I am currently an undergrad student at Nirma University in India. I have been contributing to [SciPy](https://www.github.com/scipy/scipy) since 2020 and am currently a maintainer. I am also doing a project under Google Summer of Code (GSoC) with SciPy. I will be integrating C library [UNU.RAN](http://statmath.wu.ac.at/software/unuran/) in `scipy.stats` to sample pseudorandom numbers from non-standard univariate continuous and discrete distributions. Look at my [Python GSoC Blog Page](https://blogs.python-gsoc.org/en/tirthasheshpatels-blog/) for a weekly log of my activity. I have previously participated in GSoC with the PyMC team to build a Gaussian Process Interface for [PyMC4](https://www.github.com/pymc-devs/pymc4) (now archived). Apart from programming, I like to play table tennis (but I am not good at sports in general).

Please look at my [resume]({static}../pdfs/TirthPatelResume.pdf) if you want to know more about me!

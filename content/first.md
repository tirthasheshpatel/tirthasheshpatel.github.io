# Learning Pelican

Pelican is an awesome Python project to convert these markdown files to
beautiful html pages. It is one of the most *flexible* tools IMO. This
being said, I will be porting my website to Pelican very soon. Though, 
as I have been adding a lot of blog posts with specialized sections, I will
need to learn a lot of Pelican before successfully supplanting my current
website style. I hope this makes it easier for me to write more blogs with
the style I prefer and which is easy to change. As I am not a Javascript and
esspecially css veteran, tools like Pelican are truly life saving!

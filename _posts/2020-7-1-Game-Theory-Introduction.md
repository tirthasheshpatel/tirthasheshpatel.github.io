### Self-Interested Agents and Utility

- ***Self interested*** means:
  - Not that they want to harm others but that they only care about themselves.
  - The agent has its own description of the states of the world and acts based on that description.

- Each Agent has its ***utility function***.
  - `quantifies` degree of preferance across alternatives.
  - explains the impact of `uncertainties`.
  - `Decition-Theoretic Rationality`: act to maximize expected utility.

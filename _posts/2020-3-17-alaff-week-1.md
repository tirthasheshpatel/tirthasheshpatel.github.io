This was a long-ass week with a lot of problems and homework!

### Definition of a "norm" function

**Definition**: A functions $f: \mathbb{C}^{m} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a norm if, $\forall x, y \in \mathbb{C}^{m}$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, if satisfies:
$$
f(x) > 0 \text{, } x > 0 & \text{Psitive Definiteness} \\
f(\alpha x) = |\alpha|x  & \text{Homogeniety} \\
f(x + y) \le f(x) + f(y) & \text{Triangular Inequality}
$$

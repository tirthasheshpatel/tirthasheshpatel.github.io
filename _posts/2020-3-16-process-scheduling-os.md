### Abstract

In this article, I have collected and reviewed various algorithms present for short term scheduling. The first section introduces the concept of short term scheduling and its importance in efficient CPU utilization. In further sections, I introduce the scheduling algorithms and thier efficiency. This article ends with techniques for searching the values for free parameters present in various scheduling algorithms introduced in former sections. You may want to refer to my previous article on process creation to get a idea of the concept of processes in operation systems.

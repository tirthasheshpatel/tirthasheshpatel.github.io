I am a undergrad in computer science at Nirma University, Ahmedabad, India. I write articles on machine learning, deep learning, statistics, physics and astronomy. I mostly use Python and C/C++ for all of my work and I hate Java ;). This is a small website with a collection of my articles, projects and some random stuff.
